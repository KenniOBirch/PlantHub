This software project is a plant-centric website that provides users with the ability to view and store information about various types of plants. 
It follows a three-tier architecture, consisting of a presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data access layer. 

The presentation layer is designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and exposes an API that communicates with the business logic layer. 
The business logic layer is responsible for processing data and business rules, and utilizes DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to transfer data between the presentation and data access layers. 

The data access layer, which is responsible for accessing the data store, implements the DAO design pattern. The DAO resides within the API, which serves as an intermediary layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer. 

The project has been designed to adhere to industry best practices, including the use of asynchronous programming, automated testing, and secure authentication protocols. Furthermore, the website contains extensive documentation and can serve as a useful reference for anyone looking to learn or implement similar architectural concepts in their own projects.
